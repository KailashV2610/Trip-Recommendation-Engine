About Vail North America's biggest and most popular ski resort, Vail is an alpine village in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. Long a favorite of serious skiers and jet setting celebrities, Vail now also draws a younger, hipper snowboarding crowd. Skiing is king at Vail Mountain and the Blue Sky Basin, but the area's vast splendor is perfect for hiking, biking, snowmobiling or scenery-gazing at any time of the year.
