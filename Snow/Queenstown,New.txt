Outdoor enthusiasts come here for the kayaking, bungee jumping, jetboating, white-water rafting, hiking, and skiing. More mild-mannered adventurers can take a quiet cruise through nearby Milford Sound, part of the Fiordland National Park World Heritage area, or sample South Island pinot noir from one of the region's 75 wineries.
