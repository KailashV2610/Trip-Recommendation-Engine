About Saalbach-Hinterglemm In Saalbach-Hinterglemm, the hills are alive with the sound of happy travelers. Nestled in the Austrian Alps, it’s a skier’s dream, featuring a network of pistes and perfect powder. There’s plenty to do in the summer months, like hiking, mountain biking, geocaching or exploring the mountain forest from above, via a “treetop path” that’s a series of bridges, platforms and towers.
