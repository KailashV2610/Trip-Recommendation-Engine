About Livigno Snowboarders are an afterthought at a lot of resorts, but they get plenty of attention at this destination in the Italian Alps. Gold medalists regularly practice their spins and flips at the expert-level Mottolino Snowpark on the eastern slopes. Across the valley, Carosello 3000 has a terrain park for intermediate freestylers. The ski runs are challenging, but not too challenging, with only a handful of truly difficult patches. Because the slopes are so forgiving, Livigno is a great place to try off-piste skiing and snowboarding. The village soaks up the sun all winter long, so the main drag is always full of strollers. This is also a duty-free zone, with tons of shops catering to bargain-hunters.
