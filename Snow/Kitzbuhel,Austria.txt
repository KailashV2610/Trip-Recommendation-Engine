About Kitzbuhel One of Austria's most luxurious ski resorts, ritzy Kitzbühel, known as "Kitz," basks between the Hahnenkamm and Kitzbüheler Horn mountains. Every winter, Hahnenkamm's Streif slope is the site of one of the hardest downhill runs of the World Cup Ski Race. In summer, this Tirolean town sees tennis fans arrive in droves for the Austrian Open. Its winding, cobblestone medieval streets are packed with sports cars and upscale boutiques as Europe's glitterati descend on these hallowed slopes.
