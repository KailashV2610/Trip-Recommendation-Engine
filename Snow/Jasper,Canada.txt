About Jasper Escape the urban bustle and make Jasper your home base for exploring Canada's extraordinary wilderness. As a mountain town, it's low-key and unpretentious with good food and drink; as a destination, it's an outdoor sports lover's playground, with hiking and golfing in summer and skiing and dog sledding in winter. If it's chilly, heat up at Miette Hot Springs in the National Park.
