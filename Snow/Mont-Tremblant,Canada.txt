About Mont Tremblant Skiiers have flocked to Mont Tremblant since its first chairlift and lodge opened in 1939. Now, though, it's just as popular with snowboarders, who love its 18 acres of ramps, rails and jumps, and its Olympic-caliber superpipe. Don't fret, though, because despite its name, this mountain doesn't actually tremble... unless you've tossed back a few too many in one of the village's bars!
