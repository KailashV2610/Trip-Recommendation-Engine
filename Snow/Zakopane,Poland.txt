About Zakopane Just a few miles from the Slovak border in south central Poland, Zakopane is a resort town in the Tatra Mountains, popular with skiers in winter and with hikers and climbers year-round. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Zakopane grew into Polandâ€™s most visible art colony, a hotbed of culture ended by Soviet influence after World War II. Today it harkens back to an earlier time, complete with gorgeous wooden houses. Learn about these buildings and more at the Museum of Zakopane Style.
