About Lech Glitzy Lech is one of Austria's most moneyed resort towns. Pricy, posh palaces abound, but this ostentatious, old-school winter wonderland has accommodations and a place on the pistes for all budgets. Popular since the 1920 and 1930s, this former farming town has managed to retain its original character and charm. Its somewhat isolated location forces an often tricky drive in inclement weather but also is part of what appeals to celebrity admirers. Nearest airports are Zurich and Innsbruck.
