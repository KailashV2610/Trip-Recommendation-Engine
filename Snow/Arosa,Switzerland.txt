About Arosa Nestled in a the beautiful Schanfigg Valley, Arosa is the very picture of an Alps village, from its diverse array of ski runs to the charming wooden houses that are so quintessentially Swiss. If you want, you can round out your ski vacation with concerts, architectural tours, and a visit to the 500-year-old Bergkirchli mountain chapel.
