'''From sea to shining seaâ€”with plenty of road trips in between. Thereâ€™s a reason road trips are fundamental to American life: In a country this huge and packed with so much wonder, itâ€™s hard to stay put in one place. Plus getting around is part of the fun if youâ€™re taking in Californiaâ€™s rocky coastline on the Pacific Coast Highway, New Englandâ€™s fall foliage on Route 1, or the purple mountains along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Or you might be on a quest to discover the countryâ€™s best food (Chicagoâ€™s deep-dish pizza is a good start), music (street-corner jazz in New Orleans or honky-tonk country in Nashville), or outdoor adventures (the Grand Canyon is called â€œgrandâ€ for a reason). Even if you just want to kick backâ€”hello, Florida beaches!â€”donâ€™t be surprised if you feel the urge to keep exploring everything the U.S. of A offers.''',
