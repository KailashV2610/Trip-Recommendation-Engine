About Sydney With towering skyscrapers and landmarks, Sydney has all the big-city energy—but with a twist. Its easy access to nature (surf spots and bushwalks are right at your fingertips) means there’s plenty of breathing room, too. And summertime (through February) brings everyone out and exploring. The city makes the most of the weather, frontloading the calendar with events like the Sydney Festival, Chinese New Year, and WorldPride. But of course, its iconic Opera House and its cliff-top coastal walks are amazing any time of year. Take a ride up the Sydney Tower Eye, and it’ll give you a top-down view on the city and all its attractions. But leave some time to relax as locals do, whether that’s sunbathing on Bondi Beach or sipping a flat white in one of the city’s coffee shops.
