About Ibiza Ibiza: Old Spanish for "party 'til you drop." Perhaps not literally, but this is definitely one of Europe's favorite nightlife playgrounds. Ibiza boasts more than 100 miles of coastline with some 50 beaches, plus plenty of restaurants, bars, and water sportsâ€”and clubs, of course. Fit in a little culture and visit Ibiza's UNESCO-designated old town.
