About Zihuatanejo While resorts continue to spring up, "Zihua" remains determined to maintain its small-town flavor. The brick-paved "fisherman's walk," a nod to the region's seafaring roots, stretches along the town center. Because the nightlife is mostly informal, Zihua is particularly appealing to couples and those seeking an escape from coastal party towns.
