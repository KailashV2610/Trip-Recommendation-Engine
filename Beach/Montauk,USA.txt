About Montauk A 200-year-old lighthouse serves as a beacon for the Long Island town of Montauk, where fishing, beachcombing, kayaking and surfing vie for your attention. Pack a camera and binoculars for seal watching walks in Montauk Point State Park during the winter. Second House, a 1700s cottage built for East Hampton shepherds, adds to the local history. Summer season brings live music to the town's pubs and cafes. Hither Hills State Park provides access to ocean swimming, a 40-acre freshwater pond and camp sites.
