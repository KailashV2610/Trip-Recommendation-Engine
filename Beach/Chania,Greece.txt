About Chania Town Much of the old town district of Chania was developed around its harbor, which was built by the Venetians during the 14th century. Its lighthouse still proudly overlooks the Mediterranean. Here you’ll find several cinemas and historical attractions like the Archaeological Museum, a collection of Minoan and Roman artifacts that’s housed in the former Monastery of Saint Francis. Word nerds will especially enjoy the Museum of Typography.
