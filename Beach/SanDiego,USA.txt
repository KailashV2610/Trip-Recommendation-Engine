The ultimate in laid-back California style Of all the major Cali cities, San Diego best embodies laid-back California. Its surf culture, beckoning beaches, and postcard-perfect weather are enchanting. But don’t be fooled: San Diego is a major metropolis in its own right. Its serious food scene prides itself on a blend of Michelin nods and cheap eats—no trip is complete without a fresh fish taco in La Jolla. And it’s pure paradise for families, outdoor enthusiasts, and party people who love to bar-hop the thumping Gaslamp Quarter.
