About Tulum Yes, Tulum may well be one of the most Instagrammed spots in Mexico, with plenty of smoothie stands and yoga retreats, but the Caribbean beach town is so much more. In between dips in the cerulean waters, you can hike through dense jungle and explore a subterranean river at LabnaHa Eco Park. Or tour the ancient Mayan ruins that tower over town. (Tulum was the last city inhabited by the indigenous group.) Or hop on an ATV for an off-roading adventure across the sugary sand dunes. And after all that heart-pumping activity, eat your heart out at the authentic mezcalerias, low-key beach shacks, and celeb-chef, fine-dining spots.
