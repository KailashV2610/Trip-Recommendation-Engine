From sea to shining sea—with plenty of road trips in between There’s a reason road trips are fundamental to American life: In a country this huge and packed with so much wonder, it’s hard to stay put in one place. Plus getting around is part of the fun if you’re taking in California’s rocky coastline on the Pacific Coast Highway, New England’s fall foliage on Route 1, or the purple mountains along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Or you might be on a quest to discover the country’s best food (Chicago’s deep-dish pizza is a good start), music (street-corner jazz in New Orleans or honky-tonk country in Nashville), or outdoor adventures (the Grand Canyon is called “grand” for a reason). Even if you just want to kick back—hello, Florida beaches!—don’t be surprised if you feel the urge to keep exploring everything the U.S. of A offers.
