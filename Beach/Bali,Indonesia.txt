A tropical haven for beach bums, wellness worshipers, and the culturally curious No island has enchanted travelers quite like Bali. Less than half the size of Hawaii’s big island, Bali manages to pack countless adventures into one small package. Dazzling beaches beckon the sun seekers and surfers along the island’s southwest coast, while ancient temples and a thriving wellness scene draw travelers inland to Ubud. It’s the kind of place where hedonists, relaxation-seekers, and ecotourists can all find something to enjoy, from wild nightclubs in Seminyak and Kuta to luxury clifftop hotels in Nusa Dua to the pristine jungles and volcanic landscapes of the island’s north.
