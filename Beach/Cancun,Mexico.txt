About Cancun Cancun’s a pretty well-known spot for spring breakers (and spring breakers at heart)—but its fun-loving spirit, miles of resorts, and nonstop nightlife is only one small part of the story. The city is one of Mexico’s all-around gems—literally made for vacationing. Its velvety beaches are some of the best the Caribbean has to offer, while scuba divers and snorkeling buffs alike will find plenty of action in the surf, including the Museo Subacuático de Arte, with its more than 500 underwater sculptures. On the outskirts of the city, sites like the pyramids of Chichen Itza give a deep-dive on the area’s sacred Mayan heritage.
