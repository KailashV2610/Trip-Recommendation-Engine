A welcoming oasis for nature lovers with pinch-me-I-must-be-dreaming beaches Stark volcanic landscapes, emerald valleys, and black-sand beachesâ€”Maui really brings the drama. Sure, there are plenty of resorts and hotels here, but Maui never loses itself to tourism. Instead, it remains grounded in lush nature, Hawaiian culture, and aloha spirit. And seeing the sun rise from the summit of Haleakala or driving the Road to Hana will make even the most jaded traveler think this is paradise found.
