The Goght River in Armenia carves through this beautiful, eye-catching gorge, referred to as Garni Gorge and located next to a village with the same name.The cliffs themselves are extremely beautiful, consisting mainly of well-preserved basalt columns. The orderly pentagonal columns look almost man-made and are called the “Symphony of Stones” by locals.
