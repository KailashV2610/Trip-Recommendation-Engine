About Cinque Terre. You'll find rugged beauty and a slow pace in the Cinque Terre. Named for the five towns of Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore, this portion of the Italian Riviera is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Cars aren't allowed, so take local trains or ferries to go from town to townâ€”or walk one of the spectacular trails that connect them.
