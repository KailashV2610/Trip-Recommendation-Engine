About Dakar. At the westernmost point of the African continent, Dakar stands as a multicultural, diverse city full of vibrant arts and traditions. Residents from various ethnic groups present assorted crafts, foods, jewelry, fabrics and wood and metal goods at bustling markets such as Marche Sandaga or Marche HLM. The city is home to museums and mosques, cliff walks and beaches, and makes a convenient jumping point for excursions to any of Senegal's national parks and nature reserves.
