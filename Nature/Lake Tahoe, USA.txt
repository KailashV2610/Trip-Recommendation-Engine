South Lake Tahoe shines as a destination that combines two strikingly different worlds: the spectacular beauty of a national park and all the desirable amenities of a world-class resort. Here you can enjoy a full range of exhilarating outdoor activities – from skiing and snowmobiling, snowshoeing, sleigh rides and sledding to hiking, biking, kayaking, boating, fishing, swimming, and golf—alongside the excitement of 24-hour nightclubs, fine dining, gaming and entertainment.
