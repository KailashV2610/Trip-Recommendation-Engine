This massive, mountainous national park in southern Patagonia is known for its scenic glaciers, beautiful lakes, lush forests, and the three iconic granite peaks of Paine Massif. It is a great place for hiking, too. Go on a day hike, or embark on a multi-day adventure on the W and O Treks to fully soak in the beauty of this remote natural wonder. Book any overnight campsites, lodges or refugios in advance, or sign up for a guided tour which typically covers accommodation.

September to May are the best months to visit—December to February is especially great as there are up to 17 hours of daylight.
