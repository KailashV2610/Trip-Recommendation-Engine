Get up close and personal with a volcano at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Stop by the Kilauea Visitor Center to pick up a map and ask a ranger for their recommendation on the best route.

Hike the Kilauea Iki lava field, check out the Nahuku Thurston lava tubes, and drive the Chain of Craters Road. Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sunscreen, and don’t forget headlamps and binoculars if you’re planning to experience the molten lava’s glow at night. There’s so much to do at this experience of a lifetime—consider extending your visit by booking a stay at the Volcano House Hotel.
