Picture this: glowing red rocks, clear blue skies, and the most eye-popping sunsets you’ve ever seen. That’s Sedona. An outdoor lover’s paradise with more than 200 trails, Sedona was made for biking, hiking, and rock-climbing—just be sure to check the difficulty level before lacing up your boots. Another major draw? The area’s vortexes, said to be the world’s greatest hot spots for psychic energy. Put it to the test by visiting the show-stopping Cathedral Rock. (Spiritual practitioners believe the best energy is found three-quarters of a mile up in a spot called “The Saddle.”) Or renew and reset at one of the many spas and resorts. Treatments go beyond the usual hot-stone massages with sound baths and crystals. Come nightfall, stay up to experience near-perfect conditions for stargazing.
