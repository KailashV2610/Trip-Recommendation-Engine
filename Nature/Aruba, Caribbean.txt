The quintessential Caribbean island, Aruba is all sun and sea and stretches of powdery sand. Time slows to a languid pace here as you linger over a tropical drink or bob serenely in the water; only the parrotfish are in a hurry. Oranjestad's pastel facades of landmarks and shops boost the capital city's playful vibe. Scout out a shady hammock—the perfect spot for a nap—as the crashing waves of turquoise water create a soothing soundtrack.
