Once a sleepy fishing village, Placencia has emerged as an increasingly popular eco-destination on the Caribbean. For those who enjoy outdoor adventure, the Stann Creek region offers a host of activities: hiking through mountainous rain forests, kayaking, deep sea fishing, diving and exploring Mayan ruins. The peninsula boasts 16 miles of tranquil beaches, with a lagoon to the west and the Caribbean to the east and lots of peace and quiet in the middle. Tour guides and dive centers offer a variety of excursions, with boat rides to the outer cayes an ongoing favorite. Also popular are guided land tours to Mayan Ruins or trekking the jungle trails of Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the first Jaguar Reserve in the world was established.
