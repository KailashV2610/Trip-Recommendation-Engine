This horseshoe-shaped incised meander of the Colorado River is just a short hike from the beginning of Grand Canyon National Park. The overlook point, which can be accessed via the town of Page, is particularly popular during sunset when the landscape is at its most vibrant, and the iconic turquoise bend glows against the orange cliffs. Although the desert hike is relatively easy, you won’t encounter much shade, so be sure to bring a hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water.

To maximize your time here, join a tour that includes other picturesque sights like Glen Canyon Dam and Antelope Canyon.
