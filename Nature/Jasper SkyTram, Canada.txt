Jasper SkyTram is the longest and highest guided aerial tramway in Canada. Gain a unique perspective on the majesty of UNESCO World Heritage-listed Jasper National Park. Soar above the parkâ€™s sub-alpine vegetation, watching for wildlife below, as you gently climb towards the upper station located at 2,263 metres (7,425 feet) above sea level. Stroll along the accessible, interpretive boardwalk or try hiking the 1.4 km trail to the summit of Whistlers Mountain at 2,463 metres (8,081 feet). This family-friendly ride on the Jasper SkyTram is the perfect experience for guests of all ages. Make sure to stop at the top of the Canadian Rockies to visit the gift shop at the upper station for a souvenir to take home. From late March to early May, you can rent snowshoes at the top for a truly Canadian experience.
