"For simple beauty, Cape Breton outrivals them all." So said Alexander Graham Bell of the island he adopted as his home. Rich with Celtic, Mi'kmaq and Acadian heritage, Cape Breton is a delight for history buffs, music lovers and explorers of nature. Immerse yourself in 18th-century life at the Fortress of Louisbourg, explore the winding roads and Atlantic vistas of the Cabot Trail, and seek out a local Ceilidh for a lively and rousing experience.
