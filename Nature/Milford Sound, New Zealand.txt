Milford Sound is a stunning natural wonder located on the southwest coast of New Zealand's South Island. As a tourist, I was in awe of the towering Mitre Peak, cascading waterfalls, and teeming wildlife such as dolphins, seals, and penguins. The beauty of the sound was enhanced by the ever-changing weather conditions, with mist and clouds creating a mystical atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed taking a leisurely boat ride along the sound, soaking up the breathtaking scenery and learning about the fascinating history and geology of the area. Milford Sound is truly a must-see destination for any nature lover visiting New Zealand.
