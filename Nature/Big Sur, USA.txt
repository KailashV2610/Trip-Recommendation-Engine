Big Sur is a breathtaking and scenic area in California, USA. As a tourist, I was captivated by the stunning views of the Pacific Ocean, rocky cliffs and beautiful beaches. The landscape is lush with redwoods and other trees, with winding roads that take you through narrow mountain passes and over rushing streams. The charming towns with their eclectic range of restaurants and inns provided a beautiful experience. One should definitely not miss the iconic Bixby Bridge, which is a popular spot for taking pictures. Overall, Big Sur is an ideal place for hiking, camping, relax among nature and soak in its gorgeous surroundings.
