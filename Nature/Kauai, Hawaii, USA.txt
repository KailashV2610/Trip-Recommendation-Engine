Lydgate Farms is run by our fifth generation Kaua’i family. Our farm has twice been recognized as producing one of the best tasting chocolates in the world by the Cocoa of Excellence Awards in Paris, France (2017, 2021). We grow high-quality cacao to make the finest craft chocolate. We also grow award-winning vanilla and honey. Our 46-acre farm sits above the town of Kapa’a, between Sleeping Giant and Mt. Wai’ale’ale. Lydgate Farms is in an ahupua’a (land division) named Olohena, known for its rolling hills and the numerous springs and rivers that make this valley fertile for growing. Often called the Garden Island, Kaua’i is the oldest of the Hawaiian Islands and, as a result, has the most developed soils and fertile growing conditions. In addition to our specialty crops, you’ll find a wide variety of botanicals around our farm that influence the taste of our honey and chocolate. Visit us in Wailua for an interactive farm tour and chocolate tasting. Book online today.
