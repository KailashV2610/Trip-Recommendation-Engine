This man-made reservoir, located in northern Arizona and southern Utah, is a great spot for travelers seeking nature and outdoor adventure. Embark on a boat tour from either Wahweap Marina or Antelope Point Marina and witness the magnificent rock formations along the lake, like Navajo Canyon and the Toilet Bowl. It is also a haven for fishing and water sports, including boating, jet skiing, and kayaking. You can even camp in the area and explore other natural landmarks, like the iconic Horseshoe Bend.
