As a tourist in Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica, I am in awe of its impressive size and power. The active volcano dominates the landscape, with its distinctive cone shape and constant plumes of smoke rising from its peak. I am surrounded by lush rainforest, hot springs, and flowing rivers which offer me the perfect adrenaline-filled activities such as zip lining, hiking on hanging bridges and white water rafting helping me escape into the wild. Every day, I am mesmerised by the spectacle of red lava flowing down the mountain during a night tour. It's a destination that captures both adventure seekers and nature lovers.
