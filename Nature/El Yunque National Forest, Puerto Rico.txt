Plan a day trip to the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System. With 29,000 acres of lush foliage and 25 miles of year-round trails, this is a nature enthusiast’s sanctuary. Attempt to spot elusive wildlife like the Puerto Rican parrot on a rejuvenating hike, soar through the canopies on a zipline, or go horseback riding at Carabalí Rainforest Park. If time permits, visit the Yokahú Observation Tower which has an elevation of 1,575 feet and provides expansive views of the mountains.
