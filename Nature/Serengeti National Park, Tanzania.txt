Serengeti National Park is a vast and stunning park in Tanzania, renowned for its wildlife and natural beauty. As a tourist, you can see the "Big Five" game animals - lion, elephant, leopard, buffalo, and rhinoceros - in their natural habitat during a game drive or safari. The park is also home to over 500 bird species, which makes it a popular destination for bird watchers. The annual wildebeest migration is a highlight, as millions of these iconic animals roam the plains in search of food and water. Serengeti National Park is a must-visit for any nature lover or wildlife enthusiast.
