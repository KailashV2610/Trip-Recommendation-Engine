Giants Causeway is a breathtaking World Heritage site situated on the north coast of Ireland. It is an incredible vista of interlocking basalt columns, formed by a volcanic eruption 60 million years ago. The columns rise out of the ocean to form a unique natural landscape, and according to legend, they were created by giants who built a bridge to Scotland. Visitors can explore the site by walking along the clifftop trail or descending to the shore where they can step on the hexagonal columns and take in the incredible views of the Atlantic Ocean. It's a must-visit destination for any nature and history enthusiast.
