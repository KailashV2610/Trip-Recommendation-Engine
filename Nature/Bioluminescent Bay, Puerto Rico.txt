Watch the world’s brightest bioluminescent bay glow as you paddle a glass-bottomed kayak. Catch a ferry at the port outside the town of Ceiba to reach the quiet island of Vieques off the east coast of Puerto Rico. Vieques’ secluded mangrove bay is beautiful during the day but simply astonishing after sunset. You’ll marvel at the neon blue trail left by microorganisms whenever they are disturbed—just dip your hands in the water and watch the effects. 

Visit on a dark night (e.g. during a new moon) to ensure peak visibility of the phenomenon.
