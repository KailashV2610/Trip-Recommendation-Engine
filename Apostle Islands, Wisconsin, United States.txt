Visitors can hike, paddle, sail, or cruise to experience these jewels of Lake Superior. Clear water, underwater rock formations, and fascinating shipwrecks combine to provide outstanding scuba diving opportunities. Camping is available on 19 of the lakeshore’s 21 islands and at one campsite on the mainland. The park offers hiking opportunities on more than 50 miles of maintained trails in the park. The Lakeshore Trail on the mainland extends about five miles from Meyers Beach past clifftop overlooks of the mainland sea caves. Island trails provide access to lighthouses, abandoned quarries, old farm sites, historic logging and commercial fishing camps, beaches, campsites, and scenic overlooks.
