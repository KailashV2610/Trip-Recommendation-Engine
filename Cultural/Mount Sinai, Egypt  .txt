Mount Sinai, also known as Mount Horeb, is a sacred mountain located in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. As a tourist, the stunning scenery and incredible history make it a must-see destination. The peak stands at an impressive 2,285 meters above sea level, making it a popular hike, but it's not just the climb that draws visitors, it's the view from the top. The surrounding desert landscape and serene, peaceful atmosphere offer a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The mountain is also significant in religious history, with its association to Moses and the Ten Commandments. The Monastery of Saint Catherine at the foot of the mountain is equally awe-inspiring with its ancient architecture and priceless religious artifacts.
