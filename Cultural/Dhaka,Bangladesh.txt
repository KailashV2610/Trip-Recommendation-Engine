About Dhaka City Densely populated and humming with activity at all hours, Dhaka is a city of contrasts between old and new, rich and poor, industry and folk. From the concrete National Parliament House and ultramodern Bashundhara City, the largest shopping mall in South Asia, to the 17th Century Lalbagh Fort and the open markets along the city's side streets, these contrasts vividly shape the city. Visit the many mosques, temples and museums for a taste of Bengali culture and history.
