Ephesus is a stunning ancient city situated on the coast of Turkey. As a tourist, I was mesmerized by its impressive architecture and rich historical significance. The towering columns of the Temple of Hadrian and the ornate Library of Celsus left me in awe. Walking through the ancient streets felt like traveling back in time, and the well-preserved mosaics and frescoes added to the breathtaking scene. The highlight of my trip was visiting the Great Theater, which could hold up to 25,000 spectators. The city also offers delicious local cuisine and a lively bazaar where you can purchase traditional Turkish goods.
