About Belgrade Belgrade's long and storied history is suggested by its architecture, which varies from Byzantine and Ottoman to neoclassic and romantic buildings in the older neighborhoods, and from Art Nouveau to brutalism and neo-Byzantine design in New Belgrade. The city's many theaters, museums, monuments and opera houses boast a deep and fissured cultural life while the beaches and rivers attract sunbathers, sports enthusiasts and partygoers on the popular floating river barges that serve as nightclubs.
