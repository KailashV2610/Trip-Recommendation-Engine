About Taichung Among its many tourist attractions, Taichung offers a downtown shopping experience similar to that of Tokyo or Manhattan, a bustling nightlife, and a cuisine to please even the pickiest palate. Travelers come to this city to feast their eyes on the temples, markets, parks, and museums. Touring families often visit the Taichung National Museum of Natural Science to marvel over the exhibits or the Feng Chia night market to purchase local goods. But perhaps what Taichung is known for the most is Bubble tea, the most famous beverage in the region.
