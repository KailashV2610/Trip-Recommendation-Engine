The colorful cultural hub of Malaysia Wandering the streets of Kuala Lumpur can mean dipping in and out of an urban present into an ancient past. The city is visually defined by the iconic Petronas Twin Towers, which, at 88 stories high, are the tallest twin buildings in the world and a vision of modern architecture. On the flip side, the Sri Mahamariamman is the oldest Hindu temple in Malaysia, its facade a colorful totem pole of iconography. Shopping also switches from gleaming mega-malls to local markets where haggling and handicrafts go hand-in-hand.
