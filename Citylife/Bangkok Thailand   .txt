Revved up at all hours, Bangkok remains one of the most intense places on Earth There are cities and then there is Bangkok. Temples like Wat Pho are thronged with devotees all day. Street food sizzles all evening. The heat never stops. And the nightlifeâ€”from sleazy Patpong to ritzy rooftop barsâ€”is second to none. But the pleasures donâ€™t end there. Night markets, mega malls, and the massive Chatuchak Weekend Market all make Bangkok a shoppersâ€™ (and souvenir-hunterâ€™s) dream. Youâ€™ll need to prepare yourselfâ€”Bangkok is intense. But for travelers craving local secrets and 24. 7 energy, thereâ€™s nowhere in the world quite like it.
