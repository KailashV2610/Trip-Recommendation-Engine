About Miami Miami is hot hot hot! And itâ€™s not just the sultry weather. Here, the nightlife is scorching, thanks to a strong Latin influence and spicy salsa culture. Dance the noche away in a nightclub, or indulge in a fancy meal at one of the cityâ€™s celebrity-owned restaurants. By day, hit the beach of course, or have yourself a walkabout, taking in Miamiâ€™s colorful art deco architecture. Grab a Cuban sandwich in Little Havana, then ride the vintage carousel at Virginia Key Beach Park.
