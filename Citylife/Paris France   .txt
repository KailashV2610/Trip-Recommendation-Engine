About Paris Paris has a reputation for being the ultimate romantic getaway. But what visitors really swoon over is the city itself. Those grand stone and wrought-iron buildings, the sidewalks brimming with cozy cafÃ©s, and the Seineâ€™s curving riverbanks are downright cinematic. But the cityâ€™s charms go beyond looks. The culinary scene creates an endless list of must-eat French dishesâ€”rich and hearty coq au vin, golden buttery croissants. Itâ€™s also worth trying modern fusion and inventive international food here. (Trust us, the cityâ€™s falafel is outstanding.) And the spirit of Paris invites ducking down side streets, lingering in museums, and exploring mazes of shops. At the end of the day, head to the Champ-de-Mars to get uninterrupted views of the Eiffel Tower as it glitters into the night.
