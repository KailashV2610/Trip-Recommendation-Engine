About Vancouver Vancouver may have all the usual big-city trappingsâ€”renowned museums, an active theater and music scene, and famed diningâ€”but its location ringed by mountains and right by the water, surround it with nature on a grand scale. Visit the cityâ€™s forests, parks, and impressive suspension bridge to connect with that outdoor spirit. Then explore the cityâ€™s past in Gastownâ€™s Victorian buildings, cobblestone lanes, and English pubs. Or wander Chinatownâ€”the countryâ€™s largestâ€”on a never-ending food crawl.
