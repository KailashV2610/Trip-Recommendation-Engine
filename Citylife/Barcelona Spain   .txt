Perfect beaches, world-famous tapas, and GaudÃ­â€”the Catalan capital is a Mediterranean dream Thereâ€™s nowhere in the world like Barcelona. From days spent strolling the Gothic Quarter to afternoons at the beach and nights partying â€˜til dawn, the city is magnetic. While tapas and bustling mercados are worth every bit of attention they get in guidebooks, Barcelonaâ€™s true crown jewel is the work of Antoni GaudÃ­. His iconic creations, like the jaw-dropping Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, are instantly recognizable and have fueled millions of travel dreams. You wonâ€™t be the only tourist here (especially during the summer), but even amid the crowds youâ€™ll find your own Mediterranean magic any time of year.
