A spellbinding city where cultures collide  Over the centuries, many cultures have added their mark to Istanbul. Today, you can experience those influences firsthand by exploring its mahalles (neighborhoods). From the holy sites of Sultanahmet and the 19th-century European elegance of BeyoÄŸlu to the high fashion of NiÅŸantaÅŸÄ±, the vibrant cafe society of KadÄ±kÃ¶y and the football-loving streets of BeÅŸiktaÅŸ, itâ€™s easy to see why travelers say that Istanbul isnâ€™t just one city, but multiple cities within one.
