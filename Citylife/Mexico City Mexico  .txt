Vibrant food, nightlife, art, and cultureâ€”all anchored by an ancient history A sprawling metropolis, Mexico City invites comparisons to other cities for its scale and its importance as a continental hub. Walk through the Centro Historico at night, and youâ€™ll find it has the up-all-night energy and culinary scene of any other global capital. But CDMX (Ciudad de MÃ©xico) is more than just urban bustleâ€”itâ€™s a collision of contemporary life with ancient history dating back to the Aztecs. That history echoes through everything here, from street food to music to vivid murals, giving a deeper resonance to daily life.
