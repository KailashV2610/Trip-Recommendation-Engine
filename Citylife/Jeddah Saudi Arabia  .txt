As a tourist in Jeddah, I find the city bustling with life and culture. It is known as the gateway to Mecca and is a melting pot of diverse cultures. The city boasts beautiful Corniche, where one can take a stroll while enjoying the stunning views of the Red Sea. The historical district of Al-Balad is an excellent place to wander around, see the impressive architecture and buy some souvenirs. There's a wealth of shopping experiences, from traditional souks to mega-malls. The food scene is something to look out for as well, with its fusion of local flavors and international cuisine. Overall, Jeddah is a beautiful, vibrant and welcoming city that every tourist must explore.
