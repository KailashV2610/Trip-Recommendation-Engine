About Luxor The Luxor in Las Vegas is to the actual CITY of Luxor, Egypt, as marshmallow fluff is to fois gras. (Weâ€™re sure you knew that. We just enjoy analogies.)

(Editor's note: Our list was compiled before political unrest prompted many countries to issue travel warnings for Egypt. If you're currently planning a trip to Egypt, please consider the risks and monitor your government's travel alerts.)
