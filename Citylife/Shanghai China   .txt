China's largest cityâ€”and its most cosmopolitan Shanghai is a luxurious playground for the well-heeled, with Michelin-star dining, high-end fashion houses, and over-the-top hotels. The Huangpu River splits the city into two districts: Pudong and Puxi. The Pudong skyline looks like it was ripped from the Jetsons; on the Puxi side, you can walk the Bund riverside district to get a taste of old Shanghai. The food scene is phenomenal; take advantage of tours that focus on local eats, like dumpling houses. Also, donâ€™t miss the chance to fill your suitcase with custom-made clothing from bespoke shops.
