Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, is truly a gem from a tourist's perspective. This vibrant and historic city is split in half by the Danube River, creating two unique experiences. To the west, Buda is the hilly and more relaxed part of the city with its historic Castle Hill, offering stunning panoramic views. Meanwhile, Pest to the east is the commercial and cultural hub, famous for its grand neo-Gothic Parliament building and vibrant nightlife scene. Some of Budapest's must-visit attractions include thermal baths, the Fisherman’s Bastion, St. Stephen’s Basilica, the Hungarian State Opera House, and the Széchenyi Chain Bridge linking the two sides of the city.
