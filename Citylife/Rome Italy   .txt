About Rome All roads lead to Rome, so they say. Or maybe it should be all interests. Food lovers can spend a lifetime sampling the cityâ€™s pastaâ€”impossibly buttery cacio e pepe, rich and meaty carbonara. Art fanatics can tour masterpiece after masterpiece by the likes of Michelangelo and Raphael. And history buffs can explore an absurd amount of ancient sites, from the Pantheon to the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain. But just when you think you have Rome figured out, it surprises you. Just look at its nightlife, which rivals any European capital with its up-all-night energy and legendary clubbing. And even if your bar-crawl days are behind you, itâ€™s worth joining locals in the Roman tradition of an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) to toast this eternal city.
