A city where gleaming modernity and ancient culture meet The bustling metropolis of Taipei is where youâ€™ll find shiny skyscrapers and ancient temples hazy with incense standing side by side. Spend your day taking in the view from up above at the Taipei 101 before shopping your way down the streets of Ximending (with a bubble tea in hand, of course). As night falls, eat your way across the numerous night markets. From the XXL fried chicken cutlets to the stinky tofu, the street food here is addictive and will leave you hankering for more.
