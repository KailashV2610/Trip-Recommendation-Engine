About Jeju Island Where else can you find an azalea-framed volcano to climb, a sisterhood of deep-divers, and ancient stone statues on which to make wishes? Jeju Island. A favorite with newlyweds (and K-drama fans), this popular retreat is also home to miles of golden beaches, winding coastal trails, and Jeju Waterworld, the areaâ€™s largest water park. No matter what your fancy, one thing is for certain: a day of sightseeing isnâ€™t complete without enjoying some of the isleâ€™s delicious raw seafood and famed barbecued black pork.
