A vibrant harbor city with an unbeatable food scene Delectable dim sum, floating islands, and a one-of-a-kind skyline are just some of Hong Kongâ€™s enchanting features. Eat your way across Temple Street Night Market with its fish balls and stinky tofu, or settle in for dim sum at Michelin-starred venues like Tim Ho Wan. For traditional Chinese architecture, head to Ngong Ping Village, then take the tram to the tippity-top of Victoria Peak for skyscraper views. The gentle hills of Nan Lian Garden will deliver serenity, but a detour through the cityâ€™s cocktail bars will bring back Hong Kongâ€™s urban buzz.
