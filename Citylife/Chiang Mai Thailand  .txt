Thailand's "Rose of the North" You could spend your whole vacation just exploring Chiang Mai's famous city center, where the remains of ancient walls encircle over 30 temples. Energetic travelers can climb 300 stairs to Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, an ornate Buddhist temple in the hills. But donâ€™t just explore historical sightsâ€”witness Thailandâ€™s vibrant present at the Night Bazaar where you can master the art of haggling. The Botanic Garden is also a great place to soak up some local culture and to breathe in the delicate fragrance of Thai orchids.
