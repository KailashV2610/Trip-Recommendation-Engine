Jordan's UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, but outside this lost canyon city, other dazzling experiences await: the breathtaking 2000-year old Treasury, the narrow Siq gorge, the trek up to Al Dayr monastery. The High Place of Sacrifice is another site that will amaze. Hotels can arrange drivers or barter for a taxi from Aqaba. Desert resorts abound nearby and, should security conditions allow, Jordan offers countless more treasures and riches.
