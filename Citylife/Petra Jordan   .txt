Petra Jordan is an ancient city carved out of pink sandstone cliffs, and it’s a must-see destination for any tourist. As you enter through the Siq, a narrow gorge with soaring rock walls, you’ll suddenly catch your first glimpse of the magnificent Treasury, whose intricate façade is the most famous landmark in Petra. The spectacular ruins continue with the Royal Tombs, the Temple of the Winged Lions, and the Monastery. As you explore the city on foot or on the back of a camel or horse, you'll be transported back in time, experiencing the rich history and culture of the Nabatean people who created this wonder more than 2,000 years ago.
