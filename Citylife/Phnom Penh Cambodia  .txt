About Phnom Penh Budget-minded travelers will appreciate Phnom Penh's reasonably priced hotel rooms (several top-rated hotels on TripAdvisor offer rooms around $40. night). Explore the city's temples, palaces, and the remnants of its French colonial history. Just outside the city, the The Killing Fields (Choeung Ek) are a reminder of Cambodia's tragic past-- a somber contrast to the booming city of today.
