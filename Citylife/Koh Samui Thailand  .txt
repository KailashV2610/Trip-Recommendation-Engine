Palm-fringed beaches and tranquil temples that transmit peace and serenity Once a fishing community, Koh Samui, Thailand's second largest island, has retained its charming sensibility. Spending time in Bophut is a wonderful way to soak up local culture; the beachy village restaurants and pubs are perfect spots to experience the sunset. There arenâ€™t many other places where you can bask in the camp of a cabaret show and the serenity of a Buddhist temple. As far as the latter goes, Wat Plai Laem is a magnificent vision of gilded red rooftops and a massive spindly armed statue of Guanyin.
