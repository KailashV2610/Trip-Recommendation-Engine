An urban metropolis with the back-tempo of a samba sway With its plentiful beaches, dramatic mountains, and backdrop of samba and bossa nova rhythms, it's easy to fall in love with Rio de Janeiro. Made famous in song, Ipanema Beach is still the place to stroll, sunbathe, and be seen. The largest Art Deco statue in the world, Christ the Redeemer, beckons visitors to Corcovado Mountain. And if you're coming for Carnaval, Rioâ€™s annual celebrations are bacchanalian extravaganzas of feasting, music, dance, and costumed revelry.
