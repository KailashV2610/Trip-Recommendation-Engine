About Ulaanbaatar Located in the northern part of the country, high above sea level, Ulan Bator is the coldest capital city in the world. The cultural and business center of Mongolia, and a hub connecting the Trans-Siberian Railway with the Chinese rail system, Ulan Bator has become a thriving urban center in one of the most remote locations in the world. Visit the Tibetan-style Gandan Monastery, one of the few buildings in Ulan Bator to predate WWII and one of the few monasteries to survive the Soviet purge.
