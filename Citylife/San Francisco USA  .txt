A galaxy of vibrant neighborhoods connected by cable cars San Francisco has a personality as big and bold as the Golden Gate Bridge, but that personality changes neighborhood to neighborhood. Consider the tea rooms and mah jong parlors of Chinatown, the lingering hippie chic of Haight-Ashbury, and the boisterous family fun of Ghirardelli Square. The city is also home to one of the country's most dynamic food scenes, from beloved Mission District burrito joints to Michelin-starred dining rooms. When your legs get tired from exploring, hitch a ride on a cable car and take in those hilltop views.
