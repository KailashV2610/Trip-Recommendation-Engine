The city of 100 spires, Prague has enchanted visitors for centuries The bohemian allure and fairytale features of Prague make it a perfect destination for culture vultures who want to immerse themselves in history, art, music, and architecture. You could devote an entire day to exploring Prazsky hrad (Prague Castle), then refuel over a hearty dinner at a classic Czech tavern. Spend some time wandering Old Town Square before heading over to the Astronomical Clock as it performs a mechinical promenade on the hour. Pragueâ€™s best bars are often historic pubs where you can spend the better part of a night tipping back central Europe's top-shelf beers.
