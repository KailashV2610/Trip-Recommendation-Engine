About Montreal Montreal, câ€™est si bon! This French-speaking city is considered the cultural capital of Canada, and is a cosmopolitan celebration of QuÃ©bÃ©cois style. A stroll around the cobblestone streets and grand buildings of Vieux-MontrÃ©al will give you a taste of European flavor. The Basilique Notre-Dame is a confection of stained glass, and the Plateau Mont-Royal district will delight with its quaint boutiques and cafÃ©s. Dig in to a massive plate of poutine to fuel up for a tour of the epic Olympic Park.
