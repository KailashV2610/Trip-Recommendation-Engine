About Las Vegas Whatever you can dream up, Las Vegas delivers: Michelin-starred restaurants, 24-hour wedding chapels, larger-than-life scenery, slot machines, all of it. But just when you think you have Vegas pinned down, it surprises you. Consider Meow Wolf, an immersive experience thatâ€™s equal parts theme park and art gallery. Or the ice rink at the Cosmopolitan (winter in the desert!). Head out past the Strip, and youâ€™ll find state parks and scenery for days in spots like Valley of Fire and Red Rocks Canyon. Itâ€™s gems like these that round out Vegas as a destination for families and non-partiers, too.
