About Guayaquil. Founded in the 1530s, Ecuador's largest city and main port is the top access point for Galapagos cruises and home to a bustling import-export business. Tourism is on the rise as well, thanks to a new international airport and urban renewal projects along the River Guayas promenade and in the historic neighborhood of Las Pe√±as. The 465-step climb to the top of Santa Ana Hill provides sweeping views and a chance to stand on the site of the city's birthplace.
