About Faroe Islands. Bobbing in the frothing North Atlantic, the remote, 18-piece Faroes are a picturesque patchwork of emerald pastures, dotted with sheep, gaily-hued cottages and tree-free moors. The sea is never more than three miles distant in this proud, assured land, where deep-rooted traditions remain strong. The coasts boast deep fjords, steep cliffs and looming headlands. Explore these fjords by wooden sloop or sail the coast by schooner. Walk the fells and brave the unpredictable weather to puffin spot.
