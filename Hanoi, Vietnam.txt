Layered with French and Chinese influence, Hanoi has emerged as a cultural capital that's 100 percent Vietnamese. Hanoi, the country's charming capital has aged well, preserving the Old Quarter, monuments and colonial architecture, while making room for modern developments alongside. The city may have shrugged off several former names, including Thang Long, or "ascending dragon," but it hasn't forgotten its past, as sites such as Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison attest. Lakes, parks, shady boulevards, and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi.
