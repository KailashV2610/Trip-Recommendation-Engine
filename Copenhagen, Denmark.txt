About Copenhagen. Copenhagen was once a Viking fishing settlement, and you can still find traces of the Norse explorers here. Visit reconstructed villages, the remains of a 1,000-year-old castle, and museums dedicated to the notorious raiders. Copenhagen also features a blend of modern architecture and historical artifacts such as the Round Tower observatory – a wonderful example of 17th-century architecture. Art galleries, narrow streets, canals, parks, and Baroque churches round out the city’s cultural attractions.
