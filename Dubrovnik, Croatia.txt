About Dubrovnik. Medieval meets Mediterranean in Dubrovnik, where towering stone fortresses rise from the glistening Adriatic Sea. Walk along the ancient walls that surround Old Town to get a sweeping view of the city—dotted with Romanesque-Gothic monasteries, palaces, and plenty of terracotta rooftops, it’s the stuff of Game of Thrones dreams (it was filmed here, after all). There’s no shortage of beaches, most of them pebbly and low-key, but if you’re looking for a more clubby vibe, hit Copacabana Beach where you can spend the day jet skiing, sipping cocktails, or lounging on a sunbed.
