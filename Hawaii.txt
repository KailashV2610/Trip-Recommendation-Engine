The poster child of tropical vacations. For many, the word "vacation" conjures images of sunbathing on a sunny beach, paddling in a dazzling blue ocean, napping under coconut trees—in other words, Hawaii. But travelers who can pull themselves away from the 50th state's stunning beaches will find so much more. From volcanic landscapes to hidden waterfalls and epic expeditions, a Hawaiian getaway can go in a dozen different directions. Each of the six major islands–Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and the island of Hawaii–has its own distinct personality and unique opportunities for adventure, dining, culture, and relaxation.
